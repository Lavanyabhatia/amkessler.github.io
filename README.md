## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Here is where I'll put an introduction that tells people about who I am, what I'm studying, and what my goals are for the future.  
  
You can make this section as brief or as expansive as you'd like, and if you want to can also include links to a resume, though that is not necessary.
  
### White House Salaries

This is a project that took White House salary data and created a dashboard to compare who got the highest raises.  
  
See the page in action [here](https://amkessler.github.io/whsalaries/).
