## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/amkessler/amkessler.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.  
  
Hi there, I'm putting in some new web content!  

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### White House Salaries

This is a project that took White House salary data and created a dashboard to compare who got the highest raises.  
  
See the page in action [here](https://amkessler.github.io/whsalaries/).


### Biden Transition Tracking

This project scraped the Biden Transition site and captured what was new, then generated a dynamic report.

See the report [here](https://amkessler.github.io/bidentransition/).

See my github repo with code for the project [here](https://github.com/amkessler/gw_r_assignment_transition).
